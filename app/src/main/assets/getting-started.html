        Welcome to BreakTime!
    </h1>
    <p>
        BreakTime is an app that helps you study in manageable chunks. Pick how long you'd like to study and how long you'd like your breaks to last, then flip your phone to start studying!
    </p>
    
    <h1>
        How to Use
    </h1>
    <p>
        If you want to get started right away, just press Start Studying, then <strong>flip your phone over.</strong> Your flash will blink to let you know that your timer is counting down. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Don't get distracted while you're studying!</strong> If you flip your phone over, your study session will pause.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once your session is up, your phone will vibrate. Flip your phone face-up and pick how you'd like to spend your 5-minute break, then relax.
    </p>
    <p>
        After your break is up, you can tap the Study button to start a new session, or you can snooze the alarm to take another 5 minutes. Don't procrastinate too long!
    </p>
